# Calculus 3D Models: Disk and Washer Methods

This repository contains OpenSCAD file for illustrating the **disk method** and **washer method** for calculating volumes of revolution, commonly taught in calculus courses.

## Mathematical Description

- The solid is generated by revolving two functions around the **z-axis**:
  - `x = f(z)` defines the **outer radius** of the solid at each height `z`.
  - `x = g(z)` defines the **inner radius** (for washers) at each height `z`.
- If you set `g(z) = 0`, the model automatically switches to the **disk method** (solid without holes).

## How to Use

- Open the `.scad` file in [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/).
- Customize parameters:
  - `n`: Number of subintervals
  - `sample_type`: `"left"`, `"mid"`, or `"right"` sampling for the approximation
  - `show_solid`: Toggle between discrete stacked disks/washers or a full continuous solid
  - `printedheight`: Set the final height of the printed object in millimeters
- Render the model.
- Export the model to STL for 3D printing, or use for visualization.

## Files Included

- `DiskAndWashers.scad` — Main customizable OpenSCAD model with disk, washer, and full solid modes.
- `solid.stl` — STL file of a full solid of revolution (smooth continuous surface).
- `washers.stl` — STL file showing the discrete washer approximation (Riemann-style stacking).
